# UtilitiesBot
Telegram Bot that is used by me to store and process utilities data (electricity and water meters). Planning to deploy it on Heroku and use the bot every month.

## Using:
 * Spring Framework (not Boot in order to get into everything)
 * TelegramBots Library (you can find it on GitHub)
 * PostgreSQL DB
 * Maven
 * JUnit
 
## TODO:
 * ORM
 * DB <-> .ods automatic conversion (I just need this irl)
